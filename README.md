# SEP2

# Hey so it is all code from our SEP2, 

I'm gonna do a branch for each sprint so we can easily go to previous versions

 Also if you want to run this code you need to run ddl from the sql file first to create your copy of database, then in class ModelDatabase change static field to your database password, because rn mine is there

 Moreover, to run the code, you need following jars addded to your modules, these 2 uploaded in main branch (related to database) and "my observer" jar
